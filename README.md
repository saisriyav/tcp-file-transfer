# TCP File Transfer Application

A multithreaded TCP-based file transfer application developed in C on Linux using POSIX sockets and pthreads. The application allows a client to transfer files reliably to a server over TCP while supporting concurrent client connections through multithreading.

---

## Project Highlights

- Multithreaded TCP server using POSIX Threads
- Reliable file transfer over TCP
- Custom application-layer protocol
- Dynamic filename support
- Robust `send_all()` and `recv_all()` implementations
- Command-line interface
- Linux-based implementation
- Makefile build automation

## Architecture

```

                   │
              TCP Connection
                   │
                   ▼

         Receive File Data

          Save Received File
```

## Application Protocol

The application uses a custom protocol for reliable communication.

```
+------------------------+
| Filename Length (4B)   |
+------------------------+
| Filename (N bytes)     |
+------------------------+
| File Size (8B)         |
+------------------------+
| File Data              |
+------------------------+
```

This protocol allows the server to determine:

- The exact filename length
- The filename
- The expected file size
- When the transfer is complete

---

## Build

Compile the project using:

```bash
make
```

Clean generated files:

```bash
make clean
```

---

## Running the Application

Start the server:

```bash
./server
```

Start the client:

```bash
./client sample.txt
```

---

## File Verification

Verify the transferred file:

```bash
diff sample.txt received_sample.txt
```

If no output is produced, the transfer was successful and both files are identical.
